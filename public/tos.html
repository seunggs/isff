							<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
							<p>
								Welcome to Joylister, a community marketplace where you can discover life’s most interesting experiences. The Joylister website and service including (without limitation) all websites, mobile applications and other interactive properties through which the service is delivered (collectively, the “Service”) are owned, operated and distributed by Joylister (referred to in these Terms of Service as “Joylister” or “we” and through similar words such as “us,” “our,” etc.). By accessing any part of the Service, you are agreeing to the terms and conditions described below (these “Terms of Service”), the terms and conditions of our privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) and any other legal notices published by us on the Service (collectively, the “Governing Documents”). If you do not agree to any of these terms, you should not use the Service. These Terms of Service apply to all users, including both users who are simply viewing content available via the Service and users who have registered as members of Joylister.
							</p>
							<p>
								We may, at our sole discretion, modify these Terms of Service at any time. By accessing the Service at any time after such modifications, you are agreeing to such modifications. These Terms of Service were last modified as of September 30, 2011.
							</p>
							
							<h2>Description of Service</h2>
							<p>
								The Joylister Service allows locals to find interesting things to do around their neighborhood and beyond and allows boutique businesses and individual artisans to find attendees for their activities/workshops/events. Payments for all activity/workshop/event fees are transacted directly through PayPal, and we are not party to any transaction between you and PayPal, or between any artisan and attendees.
							</p>
							<p>
								We reserve the right to refuse to provide the Service to any person for any reason and/or to discontinue the Service in whole or in part at any time, with or without prior notice.
							</p>
							
							<h2>Copyright, Licenses and User Submissions</h2>
							<p>
								The entire contents of the Service are protected by international copyright and trademark laws and other proprietary rights. The owners of the copyrights and trademarks are Joylister, its affiliates and/or other third party licensors. YOU MAY NOT MODIFY, COPY, REPRODUCE, REPUBLISH, UPLOAD, POST, TRANSMIT, OR DISTRIBUTE, IN ANY MANNER, THE MATERIAL ON THE SERVICE, INCLUDING TEXT, GRAPHICS, CODE AND/OR SOFTWARE. You may print and download portions of material from the different areas of the Service solely for your own non-commercial use provided that you agree not to change or delete any copyright or proprietary notices from the materials.
							</p>
							<p>
								You may not use any robots, spiders, or similar data mining, data gathering or extraction tools or manual processes to collect, gather or copy any content or data on or related to the Service in a manner not authorized by Joylister in writing. You may not engage in practices of "screen scraping," "database scraping" or any other practice or activity the purpose of which is to obtain lists of users, portions of a database, or other lists or information from the Service, in any manner and any quantities not authorized by Joylister in writing. You may not frame or utilize framing techniques to enclose any trademark, logo or other proprietary information (including images, text, page layout or form) of Joylister or its affiliates without express written consent. You may not use meta tags or any other "hidden text" utilizing the Joylister name or trademarks without the express written consent of Joylister.
							</p>
							<p>
								Content submitted by users for inclusion on the Service (including, without limitation, any information submitted on message boards, forums or other public areas of the Service) is sometimes referred to in these Terms of Service as “User Submissions.” Whether or not any User Submission is published, it will be subject to these Terms of Service. Joylister does not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to a User Submission, regardless of whether or not it is published. You are solely responsible for your own User Submissions and the consequences of posting or publishing them. You represent and warrant that you own or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents and permissions to your User Submissions (and all content included therein), including the right to authorize Joylister to use the User Submissions in the manner contemplated by the Service and these Terms of Service.
							</p>
							<p>
								You hereby grant to Joylister a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual license, with the right to sub-license, to reproduce, distribute, transmit, create derivative works of, publicly display and publicly perform any User Submissions or any other materials or information (including, without limitation, ideas for new or improved products or services) you communicate to Joylister by all means and in any media now known or hereafter developed. You also grant to Joylister the right to use your name in connection with the submitted materials and other information as well as in connection with all advertising, marketing and promotional material related thereto. You agree that you shall have no recourse against Joylister for any alleged or actual infringement or misappropriation of any proprietary right in your communications to Joylister.
							</p>
							<p>
								Joylister will not tolerate violations of intellectual property rights on the Service. If you are a copyright owner and believe that any User Submission or other content infringes upon your copyrights, you may submit a notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"). To provide Joylister notice of an infringement, you must provide a written communication to the attention of "DMCA Infringement Notification Dept." care of <a href="mailto:admin@joylister.com">admin@joylister.com</a> that sets forth the information specified by the DMCA (see http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#512). You may be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that an activity is infringing your copyright.
							</p>

							</p>
							
							<h2>Conduct on Service</h2>
							<p>
								Your use of the Service is subject to all applicable laws and regulations, and you are solely responsible for the substance of your communications through the Service. You agree that you will not upload, share, post, or otherwise distribute or facilitate distribution of any User Submission — including text, communications, software, images, sounds, data, or other information — that:
								<ol>
									<li>is unlawful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, libelous, deceptive, fraudulent, invasive of another’s privacy, tortious, contains explicit or graphic descriptions or accounts of sexual acts (including but not limited to sexual language of a violent or threatening nature directed at another individual or group of individuals), or otherwise violates our rules or policies;</li>
									<li>victimizes, harasses, degrades, or intimidates an individual or group of individuals on the basis of religion, gender, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, age, or disability;</li>
									<li>infringes on any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, right of publicity, or other intellectual property or proprietary right of any party;</li>
									<li>constitutes unauthorized or unsolicited advertising, junk or bulk email (also known as "spamming"), chain letters, any other form of unauthorized solicitation, or any form of lottery or gambling;</li>
									<li>contains software viruses or any other computer code, files, or programs that are designed or intended to disrupt, damage, or limit the functioning of any software, hardware, or telecommunications equipment or to damage or obtain unauthorized access to any data or other information of any third party; or</li>
									<li>impersonates any person or entity, including any of our employees or representatives.</li>
								</ol>
							</p>

							<p>
								We neither endorse nor assume any liability for the contents of any User Submission. We generally do not pre-screen, monitor, or edit User Submissions. However, we and our agents have the right at their sole discretion to remove any User Submission or other content that, in our judgment, does not comply with these Terms of Service and any other rules of user conduct for the Service, or is otherwise harmful, objectionable, or inaccurate. We are not responsible for any failure or delay in removing any such User Submission or other content. You hereby consent to such removal and waive any claim against us arising out of such removal of any User Submission, whether it is your own or another user’s. See "Copyrights, Licenses and User Submissions" above for a description of the procedures to be followed in the event that any party believes that a User Submission infringes on any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, right of publicity, or other proprietary right of any party.
							</p>
							<p>
								You may not use your account to breach security of another account or attempt to gain unauthorized access to another network or server. Not all parts of the Service may be available to you or other authorized users of the Service. You shall not interfere with anyone else’s use and enjoyment of the Service. Users who violate systems or network security may incur criminal or civil liability.
							</p>
							<p>
								You agree that we may at any time, and at our sole discretion, terminate your membership, account, or other affiliation with the Service without prior notice to you for violating any of the above provisions. In addition, you acknowledge that we will cooperate fully with investigations of violations of systems or network security at other sites, including cooperating with law enforcement authorities in investigating suspected criminal violations.
							</p>

							<h2>Hosting or Attending Activities/Workshops/Events</h2>
							<p>
								These Terms of Service and the Governing Documents are in addition to any agreements, releases or other documents (the “Class Agreements”) that a host and an attendee may enter into in connection with an activity/workshop/event, including any Activity/Workshop/Event Agreements entered into through the Service. Host and attendees are each responsible to the other for complying with the terms of the Activity/Workshop/Event Agreements, but Joylister has no control over either party’s compliance. Among other things, Joylister cannot control (a) the provisions of the Activity/Workshop/Event Agreements, (b) the accuracy or legality of the Class Agreements or (c) any party’s performance of its obligations under the Activity/Workshop/Event Agreements. Accordingly, Joylister shall not be held responsible for any liability arising out of the Activity/Workshop/Event Agreements or any actions that you may take in reliance thereon, and is not a party to any transaction between you and any other user. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU HEREBY RELEASE JOYLISTER AND ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, AFFILIATES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS (COLLECTIVELY, THE “JOYLISTER PARTIES”) FROM ANY CLAIMS OR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND OR NATURE, KNOWN OR UNKNOWN, SUSPECTED OR UNSUSPECTED, DISCLOSED OR UNDISCLOSED, RELATING TO ANY DISPUTE RELATING TO THE ACTIVITY/WORKSHOP/EVENT AGREEMENTS OR ANY TRANSACTION OR ATTEMPTED TRANSACTION WITH ANOTHER USER OF THE SERVICE (WHETHER A HOST OR ATTENDEE). YOU AGREE AND UNDERSTAND AND INTEND THAT THIS ASSUMPTION OF RISK AND RELEASE IS BINDING UPON YOU AND YOUR HEIRS, EXECUTORS, AGENTS, ADMINISTRATORS AND ASSIGNS.
							</p>
							<p>
								Your hosting or attendance of a activity/workshop/event is at your sole risk. Joylister does not supervise activity/workshop/event and is not involved in any way with the actions of any individuals (whether hosts or attendees) at any activity/workshop/event. As a result, we have no control over the identity or actions of the individuals who are present at these activity/workshop/event, and we request that our users exercise caution and good judgment when attending activity/workshop/event. You acknowledge and agree that by participating in any activity/workshop/event (whether as a host or attendee) you may be exposed to a variety of risks and hazards, which may or may not be foreseen, including (without limitation) personal injury, property damage and death. You are solely responsible for all costs and/or risks associated with your participation in any activity/workshop/event. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU HEREBY RELEASE JOYLISTER AND EACH OF THE OTHER JOYLISTER PARTIES FROM ANY CLAIMS OR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND OR NATURE, KNOWN OR UNKNOWN, SUSPECTED OR UNSUSPECTED, DISCLOSED OR UNDISCLOSED, RELATING TO YOUR PARTICIPATION IN ANY EVENT, WHETHER AS A HOST OR ATTENDEE. YOU AGREE AND UNDERSTAND AND INTEND THAT THIS ASSUMPTION OF RISK AND RELEASE IS BINDING UPON YOU AND YOUR HEIRS, EXECUTORS, AGENTS, ADMINISTRATORS AND ASSIGNS.
							</p>
							<p>
								If applicable, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which states, in relevant part: “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.”
							</p>
							<p>
								Joylister reserves the right to, but is under no obligation, to delete the listing of any activity/workshop/event at any time and for any reason.
							</p>
